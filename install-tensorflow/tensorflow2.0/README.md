```python
sudo vim /usr/bin/pip3
```
## modified file to:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# GENERATED BY DEBIAN

import sys

# Run the main entry point, similarly to how setuptools does it, but because
# we didn't install the actual entry point from setup.py, don't use the
# pkg_resources API.
from pip import __main__
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(__main__._main())

```
## and then 2:
```python
sudo vim /usr/local/bin/pip3
```
## modified file to:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw?|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(__main__._main())

```

```python
pip3 -V
```
